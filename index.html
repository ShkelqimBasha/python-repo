	<h1>PYTHON</h1>
	<p>So what is Python?<br />
	 Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br />
	

	It is used for:<li> 1.web development (server-side),</li>
	               <li> 2.software development,</li>
	               <li> 3.mathematics</li>
	               <li> 4.system scripting.</li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</p>
	<h2>Python Comments</h2>
	  
	 <li>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</li>
	<li> Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</li>
	 <li>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</li>
	  Creating a Comment
	  <li>Comments in Python start with #. In the moment that python is going to se # anything behind is going to be ignored.</li>
	  Example:<br />
	  #This is a comment<br />
	print("Hello, World!")<br />
	So if we put # the python is going to ignore the text,mesage or anything else that is going to wrrite the programmer  <br />
	  and in our case the sentence"#This is a comment" is going to be ignore from python.<br />
		<h3>Python Numbers</h3>
		There are three numeric types in Python:<br />
		<li>int</li>
		<li>float</li>
		<li>complex</li>
		Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:<br />
		Example:<br />
		<li>x = 1    # int</li>
		<li>y = 2.8  # float</li>
		<li>z =z = 1j   # complex</li>
		To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:<br />
		Example:<br />
		<li>print(type(x))</li>
		<li>print(type(y))</li>
		<li>print(type(z))</li>
